    <h1>Category - Anti-patterns</h1>
    <div><p>Like <a href="http://localhost:8000/category---patterns/" class="wikilink">patterns</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anti-pattern">anti-patterns</a> are common solutions or approaches to a problem, but <strong>unlike</strong>  patterns, anti-patterns make the problem <strong>worse</strong> or even create new problems. </p>
<p>If curious, <a href="http://localhost:8000/difference-between-anti-pattern-and-bad-habit/" class="wikilink">difference between anti-pattern and bad habit</a>.</p>
<p>I originally encountered this as a programming term, where I was linked (repeatedly 😅) to this great <a href="https://docs.quantifiedcode.com/python-anti-patterns/">python anti-patterns</a> website.</p>
<p>But now, I think of a lot of things in terms of antipatterns.</p>
<p>Studying anti-patterns is almost as fun as studying regular patterns. I've even invented my own anti-patterns that I see in the wild.</p>

The key difference about anti-patterns compared to regular bad habits are that they have solutions, so the key is in identification rather than prevention</p>

Problem
I've decided to call this antipattern a clown-to-clown conversation because that's what happens if you fall for it</p>
