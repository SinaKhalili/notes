    <h1>How to use this site</h1>
    <div><p>First of all, thanks for using this site. I really appreciated your visit here. </p>
<p>For more of a "why" check out <a href="http://localhost:8000/philosophy-of-this-site/" class="wikilink">philosophy of this site</a> </p>
<p>Basically, I'm trying to make the site easier to parse and find connections with by using <em>visual cues</em>, <em>shortcuts</em>, and <em>dense linking</em>. Hopefully this will spur more thought or save some time.</p>
<h3>Linking</h3>
<p>The <strong>right bar</strong> (bottom on mobile) has pages that link <strong>back</strong> to the current page. This often called a <em>backlink</em> and can be a very useful companion. Check the backlinks section often for related topics.</p>
<p>You can always use the Home button on the <strong>left bar</strong> (top on mobile) to go back to the <a href="http://localhost:8000/" class="wikilink">index</a>. If the index gets big enough, I'll make meta-pages for categories. </p>
<p>The current page (obviously) will link <strong>out</strong> to other links in the content itself. </p>
<p>I want to encourage clicking links as much as possible, so after hundreds of hours researching test subjects in a small lab in south america, after doing countless unspeakable tasks, an optimal link-clicking encouragement was found.</p>
<p>There's a satisfying jiggle on my head every time an internal link is clicked. </p>
<p>Hopefully that'll really push you to click that next internal link.</p>
<h3>Visual Cues</h3>
<p><strong>Internal</strong> links, like <a href="http://localhost:8000/how-to-use-this-site/" class="wikilink">this</a>, which are links that <strong>stay on this domain</strong> (sinakhalili.com), are <em>not</em> annotated in any way.</p>
<p><strong>External</strong> links, for example <a href="https://www.famousdetails.com/douglas-hofstadter/">this link to a very scientific analysis website</a>, are tagged with an emoji (namely, this notebook emoji üìù)</p>
<p>Some <strong>external</strong> links are annotated with a <strong>symbol</strong>, because their website or their website creator is relevant, cool, or beautiful.</p>
<p>For example the website where I stole this from, <a href="https://gwern.net">Gwern</a>.</p>
<p>Or for example the üêê website, <a href="https://wikipedia.org">wikipedia</a>.</p>
<p>Try to guess your favourite ones! <a href="https://imdb.com">wait who was that again</a>, <a href="https://lesswrong.com">let's adjust those priors!</a>, <a href="https://youtube.com">the website of truth</a>, <a href="https://google.com">espionage international</a>, <a href="https://goodreads.com">intellectual time wasters</a>, <a href="https://arxiv.org">hey look at me I read papers</a>, <a href="https://tvtropes.org">the original backlinkers</a>, <a href="https://scholar.google.com">plagiarism hq</a>, <a href="https://github.com">spaghetti recipes</a>, <a href="https://waybackmachine.org">nope im not forgetting that</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com">meta-thread mega thread</a>, <a href="https://xkcd.com">this is reference number 1134</a></p>
<p>Can't be online without reading a few blogs, you know, like the <a href="https://slatestarcodex.com">SSC</a>, the <a href="https://paulgraham.com">lisp essayist</a>, <a href="https://meltingasphalt.com">spreading boi</a> and the like. </p>
<p>It also works for links that point to file types like pdf files <a href="http://worrydream.com/refs/Papert%20-%20Mindstorms%201st%20ed.pdf">of great books</a>, or maybe <a href="https://www.google.com/robots.txt">text files</a>, even <a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/SinaKhalili/SinaKhalili.github.io/master/coverstyle.css">source files</a></p>
<p>What a great and wonderful time you will have, skipping the line of the hover-click and deciding in a single moment whether to click that link.</p></div>
