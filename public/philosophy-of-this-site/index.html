    <div><h2>Philosophia</h2>
<p>The <em>raison d'etre</em> (ü•ñ) of this site is (1) to store my knowledge in some external medium, and (2) be a scratchpad for thought.</p>
<h3>1: Personnal Knowledge Base</h3>
<p>In case you're not up to date on this trend, it's a bit of zeitgeist thing to do in tech/researcher sphere. Some people call it creating your "second brain" or having a "zettelkasten" or a "personal wiki". </p>
<p>Basically, its mix of <a href="https://notes.sinakhalili.com/note-taking-principles/" class="wikilink">principles</a> and <a href="https://notes.sinakhalili.com/second-brain-systems/" class="wikilink">systems</a> on how to <span class="nolink">take good notes</span>. I've tried to <a href="https://notes.sinakhalili.com/note-taking/" class="wikilink">take notes on it</a> (how meta). </p>
<p>The idea is that if you follow the above principles, you'll benefit yourself by <span class="nolink">making connections</span> (because of all the linking) and you'll benefit others by <span class="nolink">sharing knowledge</span>. </p>
<p>But also, I think the whole system is maybe a <em>bit</em> too overhyped. Like I get working on your second brain, but work on your first brain also. </p>
<p>Lol.</p>
<p>So in addition to the stubby-short-toe-size wiki style thick-eyebrow objective notes, I want this to be a dumping ground for more nuanced thought, like things people would actually read. </p>
<p>I hope to make partially formed thoughts here and move them <a href="https://blog.sinakhalili.com">to my blog</a> when I get the chance.</p></div>

As an incident response engineer at Google, nearly every incident I‚Äôve investigated leads to one common truth: relationships between events are more important than the events themselves</p>
