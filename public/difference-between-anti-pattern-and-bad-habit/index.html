    <div><p><em>[ <a href="http://localhost:8000/category---anti-patterns/" class="wikilink">Category - Anti-patterns</a> ]</em></p>
<p>The key difference about anti-patterns compared to regular bad habits are that they have solutions, so the key is in <em>identification</em> rather than <em>prevention</em>. </p>
<p>I.e. smoking is a bad habit, and the smoker knows this. The difficulty in quitting is <strong>not</strong> one of identification. The difficulty is following through with quitting. </p>
<p>An anti-pattern on the other hand is one like <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brooks%27s_law">Brook's Law</a>: </p>
<blockquote>
<p>adding more resources to project <strong>slows the project down</strong> if it's already late in the project. This is from the coordination overhead.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>With knowledge of this anti-pattern, we can avoid it. Identification was major hurdle, not follow-through.</p></div>
