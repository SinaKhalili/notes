<p>It made me think of my favourite <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/askscience/comments/3i1vd0/this_coconut_oil_melted_during_a_heat_wave_and/">reddit post</a>; a user is asking about a honeycomb structure in his coconut oil after an earthquake:</p>
<p><img alt="honey" src="http://localhost:8000/static/img/honey.jpg" /></p>
<p>The top answer pointed that this is because the heat and friction created contraction and the points start contracting, and that this has been observed as a geographical phenomena:</p>
<p><img alt="ireland.jpg" src="http://localhost:8000/static/img/ireland.jpg" /></p>
<p>So we have a connection! But wait, there's more, not only is this honeycomb structure observed in various places on various scales, it also has basis in maths. The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Voronoi_diagram">Voronoi diagram</a> is the most efficient area-division among a set of points. These absolutely beautiful diagrams slice places and create psychedelic math-art:</p>

<p>So this curiosity ended up appearing in a bunch of different locations. So we can kind of <em>feel</em> there's a Voronoi diagram-ness in the natural structure of things, left to themselves, to uniformly maximize efficiency and strength. There's maybe something about <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=thOifuHs6eY">hexagons</a>. Maybe you'll notice people spreading out in Voronoi patterns. Maybe you won't. But now here's a pattern. A structure. An underlying abstract shape.</p></div>
