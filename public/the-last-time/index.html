<p>In one of his theory audios, Sam Harris mentions that by definition, you will do anything you've done for the last time. There will be <em>some</em> time which will be the last.</p>
<p>There's probably already a lot of last things you've done. </p>
<p>How many of them did you do thinking of some silly thought?</p>
<hr />
<p>You have to wait an extra hour on the bus. Detour. It's late, you're tired. It's raining. But, here it is: another hour on the damn bus.</p>
<p>Would you be more <a href="https://notes.sinakhalili.com/being-present/" class="wikilink">present</a> if you knew it was the last time you were ever going to be on a bus? Would you look at the chairs, the electronics, the panels, the pulleys, the holder, plastic-pane glass more intently? </p>
<p>Would you look out the bus window, like you've done so many times before, at that great  blender of asphalt and grafiti and road and people and telephone pole with more awe? More wonder?</p>
<p>I would.</p>
