<h3>Thinking in graphs and patterns</h3>
<p>I read a <a href="https://en.wikiquote.org/wiki/Carl_Sagan">Carl Sagan</a> quote once, which I cannot find again so it's very possible that he never said this but anyways it resonated with me. Paraphrased, it was something like</p>
<blockquote>
<p>If you keep seeing the same patterns in vastly different circumstances, then you could be witnessing a deeper truth about the universe. </p>
</blockquote>
<p>Here are some of my collected patterns. Most of them I don't understand in all their depth, but this is an ever-evolving wiki. Check the <strong>backlinks</strong> for a full list.</p>
<hr />
<p>Our brains are pattern-recognizers. If you want to think better, you might want to recognize better patterns. </p>
<p>But what is a pattern?</p>
<p>The structuralists would argue it's an abstract structure defined in terms of what it's not (ex. what is a tree? it is a not-bush, not-mountain, not-bright red, etc.)</p>
<p>The poststructuralists might argue that this not-something line of thought is infinite and leads to eating itself. They might be right.</p>
<p>In any case, <strong>connections</strong> are just as important as the things themselves. Put another way, <strong>links</strong> are first-class citizens, and should be treated as such.</p>

It made me think of my favourite reddit post; a user is asking about a honeycomb structure in his coconut oil after an earthquake:

The top answer pointed that this is because the heat and friction created contraction and the points start contracting, and that this has been observed as a geographical phenomena:

So we have a connection! But wait, there's more, not only is this honeycomb structure observed in various places on various scales, it also has basis in maths</div>

As an incident response engineer at Google, nearly every incident I‚Äôve investigated leads to one common truth: relationships between events are more important than the events themselves</p>
