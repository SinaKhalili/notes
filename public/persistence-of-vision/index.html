    <h1>persistence of vision</h1>
    <div><p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Persistence_of_vision">Persistence of vision</a> is the idea that light and shapes still have an impression on our retina for a tiny amount of time after the moment it's encountered. </p>
<h2>Definition &amp; Use</h2>
<p>Is the apparent motion caused by rapidly changing images. The idea originally was that the eyes still had some of the old motion in them by the time  the new light hit them. This is what allowed motion picture to feel like true motion.</p>
<h2>Discovery</h2>
<p>(From wiki) it started when J.M. (author unkown) noticed line curvature of wheels and assumed the light was impressionable enough on the retina that it stay a little while</p>
<p><img alt="spokes.jpg" src="https://notes.sinakhalili.com/static/img/spokes.jpg" /></p>
<h2>Problems</h2>
<p>The idea that the retina has an "impression" is likely false, and instead the image is most likely constructed in the <span class="nolink">mind</span> in a <a href="https://notes.sinakhalili.com/gestalt/" class="wikilink">gestalt</a> sense. </p>
<p>Another plausible explanation for motion perception is given as <a href="https://notes.sinakhalili.com/phi-phenomenon/" class="wikilink">phi phenomenon</a></p>

Earliest form of "film" could were made with a phenakistoscope, which is a circular device that is rotated manually and has small holes on the rim as aperatures, through which the user looks as views the illusion of the animation:

It's reminiscent of a GIF</p>
