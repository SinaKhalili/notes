## Philosophia

The *raison d'etre* (ðŸ¥–) of this site is (1) to store my knowledge in some external medium, and (2) be a scratchpad for thought.

### 1: Personnal Knowledge Base

In case you're not up to date on this trend, it's a bit of zeitgeist thing to do in tech/researcher sphere. Some people call it creating your "second brain" or having a "zettelkasten" or a "personal wiki". 

Basically, its mix of [[note taking principles | principles]] and [[second brain systems | systems]] on how to [[take good notes]]. I've tried to [[Category - note taking | take notes on it]] (how meta). 

The idea is that if you follow the above principles, you'll benefit yourself by [[making connections]] (because of all the linking) and you'll benefit others by [[sharing knowledge]]. 

But also, I think the whole system is maybe a *bit* too overhyped. Like I get working on your second brain, but work on your first brain also. 

Lol.

So in addition to the stubby-short-toe-size wiki style thick-eyebrow objective notes, I want this to be a dumping ground for more nuanced thought, like things people would actually read. 

I hope to make partially formed thoughts here and move them [to my blog](https://blog.sinakhalili.com) when I get the chance.
