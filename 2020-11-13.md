Can we decouple learning and doing math from "writing"?

It would certainly be useful, since then we could start to learn and do math, in the classic excursive style which the mathematicians use, but in the dark, while typing. 

That is to say, is "writing" math fundamental to doing it? Can we beat this? Are some people adept enough in software like maple or LaTeX to really just have that as their scratch pad?

I think so. There's nothing inherent to writing that makes you learn better or think more clearly. Euler was damn near blind at the end of his career and he thrived. I think, with the direction the world is going, the best thing for me to do would be to cultivate this habit soon. Especially because of the percieved benefits of such a thing. 

I'm going to try and write a Quine using the mathematical definiton of a Quine.
