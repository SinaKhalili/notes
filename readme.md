## Tools

This is made using this [obsidian letterpress scaffold](https://github.com/kmcgillivray/obsidian-lettersmith) as a base. Which, as the title suggests uses [letter_smith.py](https://github.com/gordonbrander/lettersmith_py), a static site generator that works with markdown files. 

To edit, I'm using [obsidian](https://obsidian.md/), which is a markdown based second brain type system. Previously I was using emacs org-roam, but Obsidian is a lot prettier.

The rest is pretty much just CSS.

### Design
I'm currently trying to use Butterick's [Practical Typography](https://practicaltypography.com/) guidelines. That means: 

- Using a reading area of around 75 characters
- Using a nicer font. Currently : [Charter](https://practicaltypography.com/charter.html)
- Making the site mobile-responsive

### Inspired by

The following sites have great design, which I try to ~~emulate~~ steal:
