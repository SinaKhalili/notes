This website is built with [letter_smith.py](https://github.com/gordonbrander/lettersmith_py), a static site generator that works with markdown files. 

To edit, I'm using [obsidian](https://obsidian.md/), which is a markdown based second brain type system. Previously I was using emacs org-roam, but Obsidian is a lot prettier.

### Design
I'm currently trying to use Butterick's [Practical Typography](https://practicaltypography.com/) guidelines. That means: 

- Using a reading area of around 75 characters
- Using a nicer font. Currently : [Charter](https://practicaltypography.com/charter.html)
- Making the site mobile-responsive

### Inspired by
