Ideas for the this website: 

### Minor
 - ~~Little inline logos for external links~~
 - ~~Images don't work -- fix this!~~
 - ~~Category pages~~
 - Import over my notion notes: 50% complete
 - Table of contents for long pages: Maybe make a plugin for this?


### Gamification
 - Gamify the site! 
 - Progress bar: shows how much of the wiki you've read so far
 - Use local storage
 - Achievements: gives you a reward after a certain amount of pages are read
 - Recall challenges?
 - Have reading stats?
